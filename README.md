# Login-page-fb
This is a responsive login page with social media buttons like "FaceBook", "Google". 

Attached the Index, Style and Script files where the three are connected in code. 
Download the images of "svg" files, change the path of the image sources in the index.html page.
The index.php and json file are used just for heroku app as the heroku app doesn't allow only HTML, CSS, JS pages without static programming like php, node js, json etc.

After download all the files store them in a single folder and Run the files.
If you use VSCode they can run ith the Live Server.

Also I connected this Git Repo with the Heroku App and deployed the page.
